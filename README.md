**AIM**:
- Classify mycelium vs moulds 
- Achieve higher throughput and production rate 

**STEPS**: 
- Importing Data 
- Image Annotation 
- Deep Learning

**Ways that moulds and mycelium can be differentiated? *These are the things
I can find if you know any more please add :)***
Present in mycelium:
- Defined lines raidating it out from a centre (round)
- Structure and shape 

- Mould if fuzzy and chaotic --> no lines, no structure 
- Some mould is blue, green ...
- Some mould looks like cob-web

## Importing Data 
- [Importing Data 1](https://nayakpplaban.medium.com/create-an-image-dataset-from-google-images-and-classify-the-images-using-fastai-c4d67d60f19 )
- [Importing Data 2](https://forums.fast.ai/t/download-images-from-google-image-search/63188 )
- [Importing Data 3](https://medium.com/@intprogrammer/how-to-scrape-google-for-images-to-train-your-machine-learning-classifiers-on-565076972ce )

- Use the fastai method and some javascript code (Google Images to a csv file
  with URLs)
- Download URLS into images
