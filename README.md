**AIM**:
- Classify mycelium vs moulds 
- Achieve higher throughput and production rate 

**STEPS**: 
- Importing Data 
- Image Annotation 
- Deep Learning

**Ways that moulds and mycelium can be differentiated? *These are the things
I can find if you know any more please add :)***
Present in mycelium:
- Defined lines raidating it out from a centre (round)
- Structure and shape 

- Mould if fuzzy and chaotic --> no lines, no structure 
- Some mould is blue, green ...
- Some mould looks like cob-web

- Use the fastai method and some javascript code (Google Images to a csv file
  with URLs)
- Download URLS into images
